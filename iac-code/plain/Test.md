# File descriptions
## main.tf
The code snippet you provided is a Terraform configuration file for a module named "common". It uses the OpenTofu backend for Terraform and defines a required version of Terraform. It also specifies the required provider for the random resource. The module "common" is sourced from a Git repository and provides configuration options for prefix, environment, and application. Additionally, it includes a resource for generating a random string with a minimum of five numeric characters.

## outputs.tf
The code snippet defines three outputs in a Terraform script:

Name_Prefix: This output uses the module.common.name_prefix value and provides a description.
Text: This output displays the text "Hello, World!".
Password: This output generates a random password using the random_string.random.result and provides a description.

## variables.tf
The code in the 'variables.tf' file defines OpenTofu variables for a Kubernetes cluster. It includes variables for the cluster name, number of nodes, node size, operating system image, and network configuration. The variables are used to customize the cluster deployment and ensure that it meets the specific needs of the user.
